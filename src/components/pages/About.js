            <p>
                I am currently learning web development at UPenn's bootcamp. In the past I went to RIT for game design and development. I first started coding for my high school senior graduation project, where I taught myself a bit of Python. At RIT I learned the basics of HTML and CSS, but primarily focused on C#. Unfortunately I was unable to complete that program, and spent a few years away from involved coding. I am very excited to be learning it in depth again and am enjoying the time quite a lot.
