            <p>
                I have just finished UPenn's bootcamp for web development. In the past I went to RIT for game design and development. I first started coding for my high school senior graduation project, where I taught myself a bit of Python. At RIT I learned the basics of HTML and CSS, but primarily focused on C#. Unfortunately I was unable to complete that program, and spent a few years away from coding. I am very excited to have taken UPenn's bootcamp, and am looking forward to using my skills for future projects.
